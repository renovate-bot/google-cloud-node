  /**
   *  Optional. An expression that filters the list of plugin instances.
   *  A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
   *  operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string. The
   *  comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>` or
   *  `=`. Filters are not case sensitive.
   *  The following fields in the `PluginInstances` are eligible for filtering:
   *    * `state` - The state of the Plugin Instance. Allowed
   *    comparison operators: `=`.
   *  A filter function is also supported in the filter string. The filter
   *  function is `id(name)`. The `id(name)` function returns the id of the
   *  resource name. For example, `id(name) = \"plugin-instance-1\"` is
   *  equivalent to `name =
   *  \"projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/plugins/plugin-1/instances/plugin-instance-1\"`
   *  provided the parent is
   *  `projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/plugins/plugin-1`.
   *  Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical
   *  operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR`
   *  operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators
   *  cannot be used together. No other logical operators are
   *  supported. At most three filter fields are allowed in the filter
   *  string and if provided more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
   *  returned by the API.
   *  Here are a few examples:
   *    * `state = ENABLED` - The plugin instance is in enabled state.
