   *  The syntax and supported features depend on the

   *  provided, it defaults to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`.
   *  If

   *  is not provided or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single

   *    * ranking_expression = function, { " + ", function };
   *  Supported functions:
   *    * double * relevance_score
   *    * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path)
   *  Function variables:
   *    * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for measure relevance
   *    between query and document.
   *    * `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field
   *    used with query embedding vector.
   *    * `dotProduct`: embedding function between `embedding_field_path` and
   *    query embedding vector.
   *   Example ranking expression:
   *     If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the ranking expression
   *     could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 * dotProduct(doc_embedding)`.
   *  If
   *  ranking_expression_backend google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.SearchRequest.ranking_expression_backend 
   *  is set to `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and
   *  combinations of those chained using + or
   *  * operators) are supported:
   *    * `double`
   *    * `signal`
   *    * `log(signal)`
   *    * `exp(signal)`
   *    * `rr(signal, double > 0)`  -- reciprocal rank transformation with second
   *    argument being a denominator constant.
   *    * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is NaN, 1 otherwise.
   *    * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if signal1 is NaN, returns
   *    signal2 | double, else returns signal1.
   *    Here are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
   *    ranking expression types:
   *    - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 * log(keyword_similarity_score)`
   *    -- mostly rank by the logarithm of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight
   *    `semantic_smilarity_score` adjustment.
   *    - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) + 0.3 *
   *    is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
   *    `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN, also
   *    add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
   *    `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN.
   *    - `0.2 * rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
   *    rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal rank
   *    of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of reciprocal rank
   *    of `semantic_smilarity_score`.
   *  The following signals are supported:
   *    * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity adjustment that is
   *    calculated using the embeddings generated by a proprietary Google model.
   *    This score determines how semantically similar a search query is to a
   *    document.
   *    * `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
   *    Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
   *    probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
   *    relevant to a given query.
   *    * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance adjustment that uses a
   *    proprietary Google model to determine the meaning and intent behind a
   *    user's query in context with the content in the documents.
   *    * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate adjustment as a rank use
   *    predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to gauge the relevance and
   *    attractiveness of a search result from a user's perspective. A higher
   *    pCTR suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query
   *    and intent, making it a valuable signal for ranking.
   *    * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a rank
   *    * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document was last
   *    updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15 minutes).
   *    * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses proprietary
   *    Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap between the query and
   *    the document.
   *    * `base_rank`: the default rank of the result
